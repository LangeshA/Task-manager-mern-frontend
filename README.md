Sure, here's a basic outline of how you could set up a task management application using MongoDB for data storage, along with routing, context/redux for state management, and a RESTful API for authentication and task management. We'll create a README file for this project.

# Task Management Application

This is a task management web application built with MongoDB, React (using Context/Redux for state management), and an Express.js RESTful API for server-side functionality.

## Features

- User registration and authentication (using JWT)
- CRUD operations for managing tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Responsive UI for task management
- Task categories and priorities
- Task filtering and sorting

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js (with React Router for routing), Context API/Redux for state management, Axios for HTTP requests
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose for data modeling)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication
- **Styling**: CSS or styled-components for styling
